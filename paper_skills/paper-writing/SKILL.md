# Workflow 3: Paper Writing Pipeline

Orchestrate a complete paper writing workflow for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Overview

This skill chains five sub-skills into a single automated pipeline:

```
/paper-plan → /paper-figure → /paper-write → /paper-compile → local review-and-polish
  (outline)     (plots)        (LaTeX)        (build PDF)       (review & polish)
```

Each phase builds on the previous one's output. The final deliverable is a polished, reviewed `paper/` directory with LaTeX source and compiled PDF.

This pack follows the AGENTS.md paper workflow: the paper architect/reviewer diagnoses and plans; the paper executor applies minimal edits and verifies outputs.

## Constants

- **VENUE = `ICLR`** — Target venue. Options: `ICLR`, `NeurIPS`, `ICML`, `CVPR`, `ACL`, `AAAI`, `ACM`, `IEEE_JOURNAL` (IEEE Transactions / Letters), `IEEE_CONF` (IEEE conferences). Affects style file, page limit, citation format.
- **MAX_IMPROVEMENT_ROUNDS = 2** — Number of review→fix→recompile rounds in the improvement loop.
- **REVIEW_ROLE = paper architect/reviewer** — Use the AGENTS.md paper review role for plan, figure, writing, and improvement review. Do not hard-code a model or backend.
- **AUTO_PROCEED = true** — Auto-continue between phases. Set `false` to pause and wait for user approval after each phase.
- **HUMAN_CHECKPOINT = false** — When `true`, Phase 5 pauses after each review round to let the user see the score and provide custom modification instructions.
- **ILLUSTRATION = `manual`** — Architecture, pipeline, and qualitative figures are manual inputs in this migrated pack. Use existing figures or create simple local TikZ/diagram placeholders only when the user asks.

> Override inline: `/paper-writing "NARRATIVE_REPORT.md" — venue: NeurIPS, human checkpoint: true`
> IEEE example: `/paper-writing "NARRATIVE_REPORT.md" — venue: IEEE_JOURNAL`

## Inputs

This pipeline accepts one of:

1. **`NARRATIVE_REPORT.md`** (best) — structured research narrative with claims, experiments, results, figures
2. **Research direction + experiment results** — the skill will help draft the narrative first
3. **Existing `PAPER_PLAN.md`** — skip Phase 1, start from Phase 2

The more detailed the input (especially figure descriptions and quantitative results), the better the output.

## Pipeline

### Phase 0: Assurance Setup

Resolve the active `assurance` level and persist it so Phase 6's local
artifact gate reads the same value. **Run once at pipeline start, before Phase 1.**

**Resolution order** (first match wins):

1. Explicit `— assurance: draft | submission` in `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Derived from `— effort:`
   - `lite` / `balanced` → `draft` (default, **zero change from current behavior**)
   - `max` / `beast` → `submission`
3. Default: `draft`

**Action:**

```bash
mkdir -p paper/audit
echo "<resolved-level>" > paper/audit/assurance.txt   # draft or submission
```

**What each level does downstream:**

- **`draft`** — Existing behavior. Audits run only when their content detector
  matches (Phase 4.5 / 4.7 / 5.5 / 5.8). Missing artifacts are non-blocking.
  Silent-skip allowed.
- **`submission`** — The three mandatory audits (proof-checker,
  experiment-claim-audit, citation-audit) are treated as load-bearing gates. Each
  sub-audit must emit its JSON artifact (PASS / WARN / FAIL / NOT_APPLICABLE /
  BLOCKED / ERROR) — never silent-skip. Phase 6 checks the required artifacts
  and blocks the Final Report on missing or blocking verdicts.

**Escape hatch:** a user wanting the old "beast = depth-only, no audit gate"
can pass `— effort: beast, assurance: draft` explicitly. Legal but
discouraged for actual submissions. See
`../shared-references/assurance-contract.md` for the full contract.

**Announce the resolved level in-line before Phase 1:**

```
📋 Assurance: <level> (derived from effort: <effort>)
   <either "current behavior, no audit gate" OR "mandatory audits gated by local artifact checks">
```

### Phase 1: Paper Plan

Invoke `/paper-plan` to create the structural outline:

```
/paper-plan "$ARGUMENTS"
```

**What this does:**
- Parse NARRATIVE_REPORT.md for claims, evidence, and figure descriptions
- Build a **Claims-Evidence Matrix** — every claim maps to evidence, every experiment supports a claim
- Design section structure (5-8 sections depending on paper type)
- Plan figure/table placement with data sources
- Scaffold citation structure
- The paper architect/reviewer checks the plan for completeness

**Output:** `PAPER_PLAN.md` with section plan, figure plan, citation scaffolding.

**Checkpoint:** Present the plan summary to the user.

```
📐 Paper plan complete:
- Title: [proposed title]
- Sections: [N] ([list])
- Figures: [N] auto-generated + [M] manual
- Target: [VENUE], [PAGE_LIMIT] pages

Shall I proceed with figure generation?
```

- **User approves** (or AUTO_PROCEED=true) → proceed to Phase 2.
- **User requests changes** → adjust plan and re-present.

### Phase 2: Figure Generation

Invoke `/paper-figure` to generate data-driven plots and tables:

```
/paper-figure "PAPER_PLAN.md"
```

**What this does:**
- Read figure plan from PAPER_PLAN.md
- Generate matplotlib/seaborn plots from JSON/CSV data
- Generate LaTeX comparison tables
- Create `figures/latex_includes.tex` for easy insertion
- The paper architect/reviewer checks figure quality and captions

**Output:** `figures/` directory with PDFs, generation scripts, and LaTeX snippets.

> **Scope:** `paper-figure` covers data plots and comparison tables. Architecture diagrams, pipeline figures, and method illustrations are handled in Phase 2b below.

#### Phase 2b: Architecture & Illustration Generation

This migrated pack does not depend on external illustration skills. If the paper plan includes architecture diagrams, pipeline figures, audit cascades, or method illustrations:

1. Check whether the user already provided figure files in `figures/`.
2. If not, create a short `figures/MANUAL_FIGURES_NEEDED.md` list with figure ID, caption intent, required content, and source data.
3. Only create a simple local TikZ or LaTeX placeholder when the user explicitly asks for one.

All non-data figures must be reviewed by the paper architect/reviewer before Phase 3, but the paper executor should not invent visual content or claim generated assets exist.

**Checkpoint:** List generated vs manual figures.

```
📊 Figures complete:
- Data plots (auto, Phase 2): [list]
- Architecture/illustrations (auto, Phase 2b, mode=<illustration>): [list]
- Manual (need your input): [list]
- LaTeX snippets: figures/latex_includes.tex

[If manual figures needed]: Please add them to figures/ before I proceed.
[If all auto]: Shall I proceed with LaTeX writing?
```

### Phase 3: LaTeX Writing

Invoke `/paper-write` to generate section-by-section LaTeX:

```
/paper-write "PAPER_PLAN.md"
```

**What this does:**
- Write each section following the plan, with proper LaTeX formatting
- Insert figure/table references from `figures/latex_includes.tex`
- Build `references.bib` from citation scaffolding
- Clean stale files from previous section structures
- Automated bib cleaning (remove uncited entries)
- De-AI polish (remove "delve", "pivotal", "landscape"...)
- The paper architect/reviewer checks each section for quality

**Output:** `paper/` directory with `main.tex`, `sections/*.tex`, `references.bib`, `math_commands.tex`.

**Checkpoint:** Report section completion.

```
✍️ LaTeX writing complete:
- Sections: [N] written ([list])
- Citations: [N] unique keys in references.bib
- Stale files cleaned: [list, if any]

Shall I proceed with compilation?
```

### Phase 4: Compilation

Invoke `/paper-compile` to build the PDF:

```
/paper-compile "paper/"
```

**What this does:**
- `latexmk -pdf` with automatic multi-pass compilation
- Auto-fix common errors (missing packages, undefined refs, BibTeX syntax)
- Up to 3 compilation attempts
- Post-compilation checks: undefined refs, page count, font embedding
- Precise page verification via `pdftotext`
- Stale file detection

**Output:** `paper/main.pdf`

**Checkpoint:** Report compilation results.

```
🔨 Compilation complete:
- Status: SUCCESS
- Pages: [X] (main body) + [Y] (references) + [Z] (appendix)
- Within page limit: YES/NO
- Undefined references: 0
- Undefined citations: 0

Shall I proceed with the improvement loop?
```

### Phase 4.5: Proof Verification (theory papers only)

**Skip this phase if the paper contains no theorems, lemmas, or proofs.**

```
if paper contains \begin{theorem} or \begin{lemma} or \begin{proof}:
    Run /proof-checker "paper/"
    The paper architect/reviewer will:
    - Verify all proof steps (hypothesis discharge, interchange justification, etc.)
    - Check for logic gaps, quantifier errors, missing domination conditions
    - Attempt counterexamples on key lemmas
    - Generate PROOF_AUDIT.md with issue list + severity

    If FATAL or CRITICAL issues found:
        Fix before proceeding to improvement loop
    If only MAJOR/MINOR:
        Proceed, improvement loop may address remaining issues
else:
    skip — no proofs, no action
```

### Phase 4.7: Experiment Claim Audit

**Skip if no result files exist (e.g., survey/position papers with no experiments).**

```
if results/*.json or results/*.csv or outputs/*.json exist:
    Run /experiment-claim-audit "paper/"
    Fresh zero-context reviewer compares every number in the paper
    against raw result files. Catches rounding inflation, best-seed
    cherry-pick, config mismatch, delta errors.

    If FAIL:
        Fix mismatched numbers before improvement loop
    If WARN:
        Proceed, but flag for manual verification
else:
    skip — no experimental results to verify
```

### Phase 5: Local Review-And-Polish Loop

Run up to `MAX_IMPROVEMENT_ROUNDS` local review-and-polish rounds using the AGENTS.md paper workflow:

**What this does (up to 2 rounds):**

**Round 1:** paper architect/reviewer reviews the full paper → identifies CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR issues → paper executor implements minimal fixes → recompile → save `main_round1.pdf`

**Round 2:** paper architect/reviewer re-reviews the revised paper → identifies remaining issues → paper executor implements minimal fixes → recompile → save `main_round2.pdf`

**Typical improvements:**
- Fix assumption-model mismatches
- Soften overclaims to match evidence
- Add missing interpretations and notation
- Strengthen limitations section
- Add theory-aligned experiments if needed

**Output:** Three PDFs for comparison + `PAPER_IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md`.

**Format check** (included in improvement loop Step 8): After final recompilation, auto-detect and fix overfull hboxes (content exceeding margins), verify page count vs venue limit, and ensure compact formatting. Location-aware thresholds: any main-body overfull blocks completion regardless of size; appendix overfulls block only if >10pt; bibliography overfulls block only if >20pt.

### Phase 5.5: Final Experiment Claim Audit (MANDATORY submission gate)

After the local review-and-polish loop finishes, **rerun** `/experiment-claim-audit` before the final report whenever the paper contains numeric claims and machine-readable raw result files exist.

Use the same detectors as Phase 4.7:
- numeric-claim regex over `paper/main.tex` and `paper/sections/*.tex`
- raw-evidence file search in `results/`, `outputs/`, `experiments/`, and `figures/` for `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.yaml`, or `.yml`

This phase is **mandatory** if both detectors are positive. It blocks the final report.
If numeric claims exist but no raw result files are found, stop and warn the user before declaring the paper complete.
If no numeric claims exist, skip.

```bash
NUMERIC_CLAIMS=$(rg -n -e '[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?\s*(%|\\%|±|\\pm|x|×)' \
  -e '(accuracy|BLEU|F1|AUC|mAP|top-1|top-5|error|loss|perplexity|speedup|improvement)' \
  paper/main.tex paper/sections 2>/dev/null || true)

RAW_RESULT_FILES=$(find results outputs experiments figures -type f \
  \( -name '*.json' -o -name '*.jsonl' -o -name '*.csv' -o -name '*.tsv' -o -name '*.yaml' -o -name '*.yml' \) 2>/dev/null | head -200)

if [ -n "$NUMERIC_CLAIMS" ] && [ -n "$RAW_RESULT_FILES" ]; then
    Run /experiment-claim-audit "paper/"
    If FAIL:
        Fix mismatched numbers before the final report
elif [ -n "$NUMERIC_CLAIMS" ]; then
    Stop and warn: the paper contains numeric claims but no raw evidence files were found
fi
```

**Empirical motivation:** in a real submission run, the final paper claimed a narrower experiment grid than the raw JSON actually contained, and a tolerance value was rounded down past the actual relative error. Both were caught only after manual `experiment-claim-audit` invocation in the final round; the improvement loop did not detect them.

### Phase 5.8: Citation Audit (submission gate)

After the final experiment-claim-audit passes, run `/citation-audit` to verify every `\cite{...}` along three axes: existence, metadata correctness, and context appropriateness. This is the final layer of the evidence-and-claim assurance stack (`experiment-result-to-claim` → `experiment-claim-audit` → `citation-audit`).

```
if paper/references.bib (or paper.bib) exists and contains entries cited from sec/*.tex:
    Run /citation-audit "paper/"
    Fresh paper architect/reviewer with web/DBLP/arXiv lookup
    verifies each entry:
      (i)   EXISTENCE — paper resolves at claimed arXiv ID / DOI / venue
      (ii)  METADATA — author names, year, venue, title match canonical sources
      (iii) CONTEXT — cited paper actually establishes the claim it supports

    Output:
      - CITATION_AUDIT.md (human-readable per-entry verdict report)
      - CITATION_AUDIT.json (machine-readable verdict ledger)
      - Per-entry verdicts: KEEP / FIX / REPLACE / REMOVE

    If any REPLACE or REMOVE verdicts:
        Surface to user for human approval — never auto-modify content claims
    If only FIX verdicts (metadata corrections):
        Apply with user confirmation, then recompile
    If all KEEP:
        Pass — bibliography clean for submission
else:
    skip — no bib file or no citations
```

**Why this is the most diagnostic of the four audit layers:** wildly fake citations are easy to spot. The dangerous failure mode is a real paper used to support a claim it does not actually establish (wrong-context citations) — these slip past metadata-only checks and damage submission credibility. Run cost is wall-clock heavy (web lookup per entry); run once per submission, not per save.

**Empirical motivation:** in a real submission run, several real papers were cited in contexts they did not actually support, and at least one bib entry shipped with `author = "Anonymous"` because the metadata had not been resolved. None were caught by the improvement loop or numeric claim audit; only fresh web-lookup review surfaced them.

### Phase 6: Final Report

**Phase 6.0 — Submission Gate**

Before writing the Final Report, resolve the active assurance level. This
uses the **same derivation rule as Phase 0** so a run where Phase 0 was
skipped or its write failed cannot silently downgrade a `beast` / `max` /
`— assurance: submission` invocation back to draft.

**Resolution at the gate** (re-derive; do not trust `paper/audit/assurance.txt`
alone):

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for an explicit `— assurance: draft | submission` or
   an `— effort: lite | balanced | max | beast` directive.
2. Derive the expected level:
   - explicit `assurance:` wins
   - else `lite` / `balanced` → `draft`, `max` / `beast` → `submission`
   - else `draft`
3. Read `paper/audit/assurance.txt`. If the file is missing, write it now
   with the derived level.
4. If the file's value **disagrees** with the derived level (e.g. file
   says `draft` but `$ARGUMENTS` says `beast`), **overwrite** the file
   with the derived level and surface a one-line warning in-chat:
   `⚠️ paper/audit/assurance.txt was draft but $ARGUMENTS says submission; overriding.`
5. Use the re-derived level as authoritative for the rest of Phase 6.

```bash
# Final authoritative value, written and read from the same source
ASSURANCE=<derived-from-$ARGUMENTS>        # draft | submission
mkdir -p paper/audit
echo "$ASSURANCE" > paper/audit/assurance.txt
```

If `ASSURANCE=draft`, skip directly to the Final Report template below —
**current behavior, no change** for the default `balanced` user.

If `ASSURANCE=submission`, run the pre-flight checklist below, then the
local artifact gate. The audit JSON artifacts are the source of truth — do
NOT self-declare "audits complete" based on conversation memory.

#### Submission pre-flight checklist

Print this checklist verbatim at the start of Phase 6.0 and confirm each row
before proceeding. This resists the common failure mode of the model
skipping audits while claiming to have run them.

```
📋 Submission audits required before Final Report:
   [ ] 1. /proof-checker        → paper/PROOF_AUDIT.json
   [ ] 2. /experiment-claim-audit    → paper/PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.json
   [ ] 3. /citation-audit       → paper/CITATION_AUDIT.json
   [ ] 4. Read all three JSON artifacts and check schema-relevant fields
   [ ] 5. Block Final Report iff any artifact is missing, stale by inspected hashes, malformed, or has FAIL / BLOCKED / ERROR
```

#### Invoking the three audits

Each sub-audit runs in a **fresh paper architect/reviewer context**.
Never pass prior audit output as context — this preserves reviewer
independence per `../shared-references/reviewer-independence.md`.

Each sub-audit **always** emits its JSON artifact, even when the content
detector is negative. A detector-negative run emits verdict
`NOT_APPLICABLE`; a silent skip is forbidden. See the "Submission artifact
emission" section of each audit's SKILL.md.

Order:

1. `/proof-checker "paper/"` → writes `paper/PROOF_AUDIT.json` (emits
   `NOT_APPLICABLE` if the paper contains no theorems / lemmas / proofs)
2. `/experiment-claim-audit "paper/"` → writes `paper/PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.json`
   (emits `NOT_APPLICABLE` if the paper has no numeric claims; emits
   `BLOCKED` if numeric claims exist but raw result files are missing)
3. `/citation-audit "paper/"` → writes `paper/CITATION_AUDIT.json`
   (emits `NOT_APPLICABLE` if no `.bib` file or no `\cite{...}` usage)

#### Running the local artifact gate

Read `paper/PROOF_AUDIT.json`, `paper/PAPER_CLAIM_AUDIT.json`, and
`paper/CITATION_AUDIT.json` directly. Confirm each has:

- `audit_skill`
- `verdict`
- `reason_code`
- `summary`
- `audited_input_hashes`
- `trace_path`
- `generated_at`

Proceed to the Final Report only when all mandatory artifacts exist, their
declared input hashes match the current files you inspected, and no verdict is
`FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `ERROR`. If any check fails, refuse to mark the PDF
submission-ready and list the concrete rerun or fix needed.

## Remaining Issues (if any)
- [items from final review that weren't addressed]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Visual inspection of PDF
- [ ] Add any missing manual figures
- [ ] Submit to [venue] via OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP
```

## Output Protocols

> Follow these shared protocols for all output files:
> - **[Output Versioning Protocol](../shared-references/output-versioning.md)** — write timestamped file first, then copy to fixed name
> - **[Output Manifest Protocol](../shared-references/output-manifest.md)** — log every output to MANIFEST.md
> - **[Output Language Protocol](../shared-references/output-language.md)** — note: paper-writing always outputs English LaTeX for venue submission

## Key Rules

- **Large file handling**: If a large output cannot be written in one pass, use the available project-safe file editing mechanism to write it in smaller chunks and then verify the final file.
- **Don't skip phases.** Each phase builds on the previous one — skipping leads to errors.
- **Checkpoint between phases** when AUTO_PROCEED=false. Present results and wait for approval.
- **Manual figures first.** If the paper needs architecture diagrams or qualitative results, the user must provide them before Phase 3.
- **Compilation must succeed** before entering the improvement loop. Fix all errors first.
- **Preserve all PDFs.** The user needs round0/round1/round2 for comparison.
- **Document everything.** The pipeline report should be self-contained.
- **Respect page limits.** If the paper exceeds the venue limit, suggest specific cuts before the improvement loop.
